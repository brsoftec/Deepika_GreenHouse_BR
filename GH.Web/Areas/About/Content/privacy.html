            <div class="privacy-policy" id="">

                <p>Thanks for using REGIT! Here we describe what we allow users to store and how we use and handle your information
                    when you use our websites, software and services ("Services").</p>
                <h3>What &amp; Why</h3>
                <p>We allow users to store their personal information like name, email address, phone number, physical address,
                    employment, education, passport, identity card &amp; membership details among others within the Regit
                    platform.</p>
                <p><strong>Services: </strong>When you use our Services, we allow you to store and share your personal information
                    with other users in the Regit network.</p>
                <p>At your request, we may transmit your personal info outside the Regit network. This may be needed where further
                    processing of your data is required outside Regit network (e.g. for credit card application processing).</p>
                <p>With our services, you can delegate to other users (in the Regit network) the ability to share or submit your
                    personal information on your behalf.</p>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> We collect information about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes
                    things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our
                    sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also
                    transmit location information to the Services.</p>
                <p>Cookies and other technologies. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags provide, improve, protect and
                    promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next
                    visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information.
                    You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.</p>
                <p><strong>Use of Personal Data for Marketing Purposes</strong></p>
                <p>We may use your personal data to offer you products or services, including special offers, promotions, contests
                    or entitlements that may be of interest to you or for which you may be eligible. Such marketing messages may be
                    sent to you within the Regit platform. In doing so, we will comply with the Personal Data Protection Act of
                    Singapore (PDPA) and other applicable data protection and privacy laws.</p>
                <h3>With whom</h3>
                <p>We may share information as discussed below, but we won't sell it to advertisers or other third-parties.</p>
                <p>REGIT uses certain trusted third parties to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These
                    third parties may access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with this
                    Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Other users:</strong> Our Services display information like your name and email address to other users in
                    places like your user profile and sharing notifications. Certain features let you make additional information
                    available to other users.</p>
                <p><strong>Other applications:</strong> You can also give third parties access to your information and account
                    - for example, via REGIT APIs. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their
                    privacy policies and terms.</p>
                <p><strong>REGIT Business Admins</strong></p>
                <p>If you are a REGIT Business user, your administrator may have the ability to access and control your REGIT
                    Business account. Please refer to your employer's internal policies if you have questions about this. If you are
                    not a REGIT Business user but interact with a REGIT Business user (by, for example, joining a shared folder or
                    accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view the name, email address
                    and IP address that were associated with your account at the time of that interaction.</p>
                <p><strong>Law &amp; Order:</strong> We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such
                    disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious
                    bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of REGIT or our users; or (d) protect REGIT's property rights.</p>
                <p>Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that our users' data
                    should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it's stored on our services or on their home
                    computer's hard drive.</p>
                <h3>How</h3>
                <p><strong>Security:</strong> We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for
                    vulnerabilities. We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like
                    two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your
                    account.</p>
                <p><strong>Retention.</strong> We'll retain information you store on our Services for as long as we need it to
                    provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we'll also delete this information. But please note: (1)
                    there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may
                    retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our
                    agreements.</p>
                <h3>Where</h3>
                <p><strong>Around the world:</strong> To provide you with the Services, we may store, process and transmit
                    information in various locations around the world - including those outside your country. Information may also
                    be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Services.</p>
                <p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
                <p>If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your information may be
                    transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated
                    with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.</p>
                <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our website. If a
                    revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.</p>
